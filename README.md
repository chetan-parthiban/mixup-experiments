The mains notebook that runs our experiment is ModelComparisons.ipynb. In it, we train each model type 10 times, as well as do the appropriate plotting and statistical testing needed for our paper. 

Each of the other IPython notebooks contains the experiment run one time for one model. We abstract this code out in the Utilities.py and TrainingLoops.py files so that we can keep our ModelComparisons.ipynb easier to read for running experiment variants.
